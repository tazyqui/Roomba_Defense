The level showcases some of the features available in Turn Based Strategy Framework v2.1. Spells were implemented with help of the Ability System. Spell targets are calculated flawlessly by the reworked AI. Turn ends automatically when player unit has no more actions left, another new Ability. Unit selection order is based on their speed, thanks to the new Turn Resolver. Finally, a different approach was used in building the scene - it consists of a background with an overlay of semi-transparent tiles, instead of being constructed from individual cells.

In the game you control elemental creatures and a Hero. Each turn you can use one of the creatures and cast a spell with the Hero unit. There are two spells available: area of effect Fireball that damages all units in given radius and Ligthning spell that jumps between enemy units, dealing progressively less damage. The game ends when all enemy creatures are defeated.
